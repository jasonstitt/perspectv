Based on these summaries from a company's website as well as expert industry knowledge, write a SWOT
(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis. Include at least 3 points for each category. 
Focus on the company and its products, not the quality of the website or its content.
We want a SWOT of the company, not the website.

If there isn't enough information about something, say so.

Use markdown formatting for the report, including using "#" for main headings, "##" for sub headings and "###" for sub-sub-headings.

Start with the company's name as a main heading. Sub headings should be:
* Strengths
* Weaknesses
* Opportunities
* Threats
